Agent based modelling is where behavioural rules of individual agents within a larger are simulation are defined so that the overall impact and behaviour can be experimentally determined.Two Agent based models were produced:<ul><li>Spread of cholera during an epidemic in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak'>London 1854</a>. Specifically noting the spread by contamination, cross infection from others and the effect of quarantine. (model pictured above)</li><li>Model fare evasion on public transport to help understand techniques to reduce its prevalence.</li></ul><img class='img-responsive' src='/images/agent-simulation-2.png'> <p class='text-center' style='font-size: 0.8em;'>Simulation of fare evasion model</p>
