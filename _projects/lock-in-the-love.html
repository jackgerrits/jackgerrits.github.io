This website was created as part of a 3 day hackathon where my team produced a product for the <a href='http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/Pages/default.aspx' target='_blank'>Heart Foundation</a>. It allowed users to receive an email with a unique upload url where they could upload a photo and a message. This was automatically added to a draggable public photo wall, which others could explore. The website was contructed in a very short timeframe using PHP and MySQL.<br><br><img class='img-responsive center-block' src='/images/hackathon-flow.png' style='width: 40%;'> <div class='text-center' style='font-size: 0.8em;'>Flow of uploading a photo</div><br><img class='img-responsive center-block' src='/images/hackathon-mob-web.png' style='width: 50%;'> <div class='text-center' style='font-size: 0.8em;'>Mobile and web view of the photo wall</div><a href='/archive/lock-in-the-love'><h3 class='text-center'>Check out a static version of the photo wall with photos from the event<h3></a>
