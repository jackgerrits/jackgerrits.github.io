The website you are viewing now has been built with a Node.js+Express backend and MongoDB for databases. It utilises bootstrap (not default!), jQuery and some HTML5 principles. <br>Prior to this current revision, the backend was written in PHP and used MySQL, Nodejs using Mongo. This PHP site had a secure accounts system, account verification and a notes web app.<br><br> Links to archived versions of some of the major designs are in the sidebar.
